INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE UPDATED PARTNERSHIP MAP SCRIPT IN RSTUDIO

1. Open RStudio
2. Open the partnership_map.R file: 
   File > Open File > Navigate to:
   c:\Users\CraigParker\OneDrive - Wits Health Consortium\PHR PC\Desktop\Partners\partnership_map.R

3. You can run the entire script by clicking "Source" at the top-right of the editor window,
   or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+R

4. The script will generate and save TWO files:
   - Wits_Planetary_Health_partnership_map_for_Wellcome.pdf (Main map with Europe inset)
   - Wits_Planetary_Health_partnership_map_for_Wellcome.png

WHAT'S CHANGED IN THIS VERSION:

1. Integrated Map with Europe Inset:
   - Instead of two separate maps, the Europe partners are now shown as a zoomed-in inset
     within the main map
   - The inset is positioned in the top-right corner for better visibility
   - A dashed outline on the main map shows the area that is magnified in the inset
   - Labels are more readable in the zoomed Europe section

2. Project-Based Categorization:
   - Partners are categorized by PROJECT TYPE rather than leadership group
   - Each partner is color-coded according to their primary project: CHAMNHA, HEAT, ENBEL, etc.
   - The color scheme is consistent between the main map and the inset

3. Improved Map Layout:
   - No overlapping elements between map features and legends
   - Proper spacing between all map components
   - Better label placement with less overlap
   - Clean borders around the inset for visual clarity

4. Better Visual Hierarchy:
   - Clear distinction between the main map and the inset
   - Appropriate sizing of all map elements
   - Consistent styling throughout
   - "European Partners (Zoomed View)" label clearly identifies the inset

5. Additional Project Statistics:
   - Generated project-specific CSV summaries
   - Added detailed project type analysis in the console output

TIPS FOR TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - If any packages fail to install, you may need to install them manually with:
     install.packages("package_name")
   - Make sure cowplot is installed: install.packages("cowplot")
   - For any font issues, run: install.packages("extrafont"); library(extrafont); font_import()
   - If map doesn't display properly, try print(combined_map) command separately
